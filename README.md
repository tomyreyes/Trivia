# Geek Trials

This is a Trivia game made with Redux and React Native. I created this project as a lifelong fan of trivia games. These types of games are very nostalgic for me as I recall passing the time with my friends during high school playing various trivia games available on the internet at the time. The goal for this app is to challenge geek savvy individuals on their knowledge.

## Features: 
+ Native application built agnostically to support Android and IOS
+ Challenge yourself with a variety of available categories and difficulties
+ Based on your score, you will either receive a gif congratulating you on your skills or a gif poking fun at you
